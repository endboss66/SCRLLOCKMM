Give an actual use to the **SCRLLOCK** button and its indicator!

- SCRLLOCK **ON** = MICROPHONE **MUTED**
- SCRLLOCK **OFF** = MICROPHONE **UNMUTED**

Running the **.ahk** or **.exe** for the first time will open a wizard, allowing you to **choose the microphone to be muted**, and to set some other options.
